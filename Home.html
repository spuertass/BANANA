	<h3>Bananas, more than a fruit</h3>
	</div>
	
<h2>But bananas are not only a diverse, good snack and an extremely versatile fruit, banana is a whole symbol is art, is a meme, minions like bananas, monkeys like bananas, everyone likes bananas. In 2016 there was an auction of the art piece called “Comedian” that is basically a banana pasted with tape to the wall, the piece started as a joke, making fun of the modern art, but it had a meaning, it was a joke of the modern art and millionaires couldn’t not buy it, it was finally sold by $120,000 and then a second piece by $150,000. Even though it had some critics and they said that a seven year old could do it, Maurizio Catelan, the creator of the piece, achieved his goal and showed everyone that anything can be art if you want it to be art. Is not a surprise that bananas are a meme, is a funny fruit at the everyone loves bananas.</h2>
